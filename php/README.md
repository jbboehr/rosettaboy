PHP arg parsing is a nightmare, so this version only supports short flags
(patches welcome!)

PHP also doesn't seem to have any non-deprecated SDL bindings, so there's
no input or output (patches also welcome!). You can run in CPU-debug mode
to see the instructions as they are executed though, and data-cable output
works so things like blargg's test roms can print "ok" or "fail".

```
./build.sh
./rosettaboy-release -c -S -H -t -p 60 game.gb
```

xdebug is useful, but makes things slow. opcache makes things fast, but is
incompatible with xdebug. To try and get the least-bad thing in each situation:

For running in practice:
```
php8.2 -dopcache.enable_cli=1 -dopcache.jit_buffer_size=100M src/main.php --args
```
